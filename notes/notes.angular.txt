angular day 1 notes

1.what is framworks
=>A framework is a structure that you can build software on.

2.what is angular cli
=>it can be download by npm (node package manager) by npm install @angular/cli

3.different usefull ng commands
=>
*ng new projectName (initialize a new angular project)

*ng serve (compile angular project and run it by default on localhost:4200)
if you want to change the port number then use ng serve --port8080

*ng biuld (use to compile and run angular application at production time because we can set url here)

*ng generate component component-name
*ng generate module module-name

4.file structure of a angular project
start with main.ts file 
this file bootstrap our angular application by bootstrapping App-module
index.html and style.css for global style and html 

angular.json file
this file contain all neceserily information about angular project.like version ,build ,architech details

project.json
this file contain all dependency and devdependency in it.

app/src folder
here all the main application related file that devloper  is working on.
it contain all module and component a project has.

5.AOT and JIT compilation 
AOT (ahead of time compilation)
application will compile on server and then compiled file will be send to browser so error will be  shown on to server not on to browser

usefull for large application

JIT (just in time) compilation occers at browser so error will be shown at browser.

suitable for small size projects

day-2

1.loading platform

=>it give angular information about on which platform app will be going to run so it can compile accordingly

2.enabling production mode
=> a devloper can not use production mode
environment can be set accordingly for devloper, production and q&a team so they can only perform actions that they are permit to perform.

3. understanding module and components and how to genrate  them 
=>modules are features of a application 
for example for a library managment system modules can be like users, admin, authenticate etc
and components are a smallest component that represt a UI in application

every module need NGmodule to define itself
@ngModule contain metadata about app-module class,
it has parameter like import,export,bootstrap,provider,
declaration etc..

declaration:[components],
import:[modules],
bootstrap[default component]

same as components contain @component decorator for define a component

selector:custom html element that represent this component
template:html code that the component made of 
style:style related to this component,
styleUrl:path of style file.
templateUrl;path of html file that represent this component
